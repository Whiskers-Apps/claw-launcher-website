        <h2>App Permissions</h2>
        <h3>Query All Packages</h3>
        <p>This one is obvious. It needs to query all packages in order to show them on the app.</p>
        <h3>Delete Packages</h3>
        <p>This permission is used when long clicking on an app and clicking on the uninstall button it shows the Android uninstall package request.</p>
        <h3>Expand Status Bar</h3>
        <p>This permission has the sole purpose of opening the status bar when swiping down on the home screen. Like many other launchers do.</p>
        <h3>Internet</h3>
        <p>The app needs internet permissions in order to get the search engines and bookmarks icons from the url. This provides a better looking experience to the user when searching/editing them.</p>
        <h3>Biometric</h3>
        <p>The app offers an app fingerprint lock feature and it's required to have it in order to function.</p>
        <h2>TLDR;</h2>
        <p>Basically claw launcher doesn't collect any personal data and all the permissions are required for a good experience on the app.</p>
